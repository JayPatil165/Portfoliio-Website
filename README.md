# Portfolio Website

## Introduction

Welcome to my Portfolio Website! This project showcases my personal portfolio, built using basic HTML and CSS. The website is designed to highlight my skills, projects, and contact information. The primary focus of this project was to practice and implement a wide variety of HTML tags and CSS styling techniques.

- **Navigation Menu**: A simple and accessible navigation bar for seamless browsing.
- **About Me Section**: Contains a brief introduction and overview of my background.
- **Education Section**: Displays my academic qualifications in a card-based layout.
- **Skills Section**: Highlights my technical skills using styled buttons.
- **Projects Section**: Displays a detailed description of my key project.
- **Contact Section**: Includes links to my social media profiles and contact information.
- **Footer**: Features copyright details.

## Technologies Used

### HTML

- Used for structuring the content of the website.
- Implemented a variety of semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, etc.
- Used lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`), multimedia elements (`<img>`, `<audio>`, `<video>`), and hyperlinks (`<a>`).
- Created forms with `<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, `<textarea>`, and `<button>`.

### CSS

- Applied modern techniques such as Flexbox and Grid for layout management.
- Styled buttons, links, and images with hover effects and transitions.
- Used pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements for interactivity.
- Designed a gradient-based background for the header and body.
